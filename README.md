# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster-Data
The dataset contains a roll of the guests on board the famous ship Titanic, as well as their age, survival status, and number of siblings/parents. Before we get started with loading the data into Python, it is critical that we spend some time looking over the information provided for the dataset so that we can have a thorough understanding of what it contains. Download the dataset and place it in the directory you're working in.

Looking at the description for the data, we can see that we have the following fields available:

survival: This tells us whether a given person survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
pclass: This is a proxy for socio-economic status, where first class is upper, second class is middle, and third class is lower status.
sex: This tells us whether a given person is male or female.
age: This is a fractional value if less than 1; for example, 0.25 is 3 months. If the age is estimated, it is in the form of xx.5.
sibsp: A sibling is defined as a brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister, and a spouse is a husband or wife.
parch: A parent is a mother or father, while a child is a daughter, son, stepdaughter, or stepson. Children that traveled only with a nanny did not travel with a parent. Thus, 0 was assigned for this field.
ticket: This gives the person's ticket number.
fare: This is the passenger's fare.
cabin: This tells us the passenger's cabin number.
embarked: The point of embarkation is the location where the passenger boarded the ship.
